# VRMFirstPerson
The setting related to first-person perspectives.

## FirstPersonBone
FirstPersonBone keeps track of a VR headset in a first-person view.
Normally the head bone is assigned as FirstPersonBone.

## FirstPersonOffset
The offset from the tracking position to the FirstPersonBone position. We assume the default value [0, 0.06, 0] is the offset between the head and the middle of the eyes.

## Renderers
The settings for controlling mesh rendering on/off in a first-person view.

When a VRM model is used in VR applications, the user may see the model's head inside inadvertently, which is not a good experience of being immersed in VR worlds. To address this problem, we provide the function **VRMFirstPerson** which can hide the model's head in the first-person view. To test out first-person mode in Unity project, set up [render layer](../../api/univrm_use_firstperson/#specify-the-additional-render-layers-for-the-application) in the inspector window and call [first-person setup function](../../api/univrm_use_firstperson/#call-setup-function-at-runtime-and-set-layermask-in-camera). Then, go to`camera->cull mask`and select`EVERYTHING`but`THIRDPERSON_ONLY_LAYER`.

### The case for the head being separated

Set **ThirdPersonOnly** on the head.
Set **Both** on the rest parts.

|-----|
|For a VRM model (below), the head is set to **ThirdPersonOnly** and the rest parts of the body are set to **Both**.| 

|{{< img src="images/vrm/firstperson_runtime.png" alt="firstperson" >}}|
|-----|
|Example: The meshes set to **ThirdPersonOnly** are not displayed in the first-person view.|

### The case for the head not being separated
Please set **Auto**.
Except the model's head, the other parts are copied and treated as **FirstPersonOnly**. 
The original model is treated as **ThirdPersonOnly**.
The parts regarding the head bone and its descendants with weights will be eliminated. 

### The case for no particular setting
Please set **Both**.
