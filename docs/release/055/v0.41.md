# v0.41

## ※Important Information※
## Major Updates:
* [Exporter] Corrected exported normal map (for DXT5)
* [Exporter] Fixed bugs that material parameters were gone when exporting VRM at runtime (for ShaderProperty that cannot be enumerated)
* [BlendShape] Fixed bugs that the list was missing when BlendShapeClip was deleted
* [BlendShape] Manipulation of UV value of Material Animation
* [BLendShape] Added a function to move horizontally with MainTex_ST_S / move vertically with Matex_ST_T
* [BLendShape] When adding new BlendShapeClip, the file name can be put into BlendShapeName
* [SpringBoneColliderGroup] Enhanced NullCheck

## Editor Updates:

* [Editor] Added version# in VRM menu
* [Editor] Added git hash to unitypackage file name 
* [Editor] Added UnitTest

## API Updates:
* [Importer] Added the argument: show. Now you can choose to undisplay VRM model when VrmImporter.LoadVrmAsync is ended
* [Importer] Extended code that relies on unpacking textures in the same path as glb                    
* [Importer] Change Task's version check from `UNITY_2018_1_OR_NEWER` to `UNITY_2017_1_OR_NEWER`
* [Exporter] Organized interface

```csharp
GameObject m_model;
string path;
var vrm = VRMExporter.Export(m_model);
var bytes = vrm.ToGlbBytes();
File.WriteAllBytes(path, bytes);
```

* [UniGLTF] Changed the implementation method of extension from inheritance to partial class       
* Added [BlendShapeProxy]``public void SetValues(IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<BlendShapeKey, float>> values)``
* Renamed UniTask => DepthFirstScheduler

## JSON Related Fixes:
Discarded `/nodes/*/extras/rootBone`.

This item was meant to save `SkinnedMeshRenderer.rootBone`,
but we found it was the same as `/ skins / * / skeleton` of the GLTF specification.

When using UniVRM in a built application,
there may be influences by `SkinnedMeshRenderer.updateWhenOffscreen = false`.

From now on, we will provide the information about the change of JSON level here.

To use `SkinnedMeshRenderer.updateWhenOffscreen=true` more convenient, we added `ImporterContext.EnableUpdateWhenOffscreen` that can apply to all meshes at one time. Feel free to use it.
