# v0.43

## ※Important Information※
The errors in VRM output from earlier versions (UniVRM 0.41 and before) have been fixed since v0.42. However, this fix comes along with the following impact:  

* The exported VRM data in v0.42 or later cannot be imported correctly in the earlier versions

When exporting VRM data using UniVRM, please check which version you use to make VRM model.
If you are using UniVRM to import VRM data, please update UniVRM to the latest version as soon as you can.

## BlendShape Object Bug Fix:
In v0.42, BlendShape.Clips will not be saved if you try to save clips in the following order: 

* Import VRM
* Close Unity (BlendShape.Clips are not saved in the disk)
* Start Unity
* BlendShapeProxy.Clips in `model_name.BlendShapes / BlendShape` are empty
