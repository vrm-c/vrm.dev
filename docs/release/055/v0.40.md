# v0.40

## Major fixes:
* (Exporter) Capable of collecting VRMSpringBone other than secondary (since VRMSpringBone's attached position is not recorded, all of VRMSpringBones will be attached to secondary during the import)
* (Importer) Added the callback "OnError" to LoadVRMAsync
* (UniGLTF) Fixed bugs in the rename code when there are meshes with same names
* (UniGLTF) Allows exported VRM contains non-Texture2D Texture  
* (Exporter) Fixed bugs where skeleton root was set and then mesh position became incorrect if SkinnedMesh without bone weight was not set in RootBone
* (UniGLTF) Added Serializable to glTF_VRM_Material
* (Importer) Added the symbol "VRM_STOP_ASSETPOSTPROCESSOR" to stop AssetPostProcessor
* (Editor) Fixed OSX compilation errors
* (UniGLTF) Fixed bugs that all textures became the same when putting vrm directly under Assets

### We released v0.40 as the version of bugs corrections in v0.39
* Importing Texture fails if VRM file is put directly under the Assets folder. There is a bug in parsing path.
